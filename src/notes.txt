Develop a Java implementation of the Language class that exactly matches this posted API. 

https://jodypaul.com/cs/theory/LanguageJava/Language.html

Note that this class must reside in the unnamed package, thus you must not use a package statement.

There is no user interface to this class. All access is via the specified public methods. Note in particular that System.out, System.err, and System.in must not be directly accessed by your program. Also note that there is no method with signature public static void main.

As a convenience, I have provided Java source code with scaffolding for Language class and a JUnit4 test class. You should feel free to use this sample implementation of Language.java while developing your class.  (It also identifies the places where you would make changes using TODO.)  The JUnit test class, LanguageTest.java, although simplistic, addresses the basic functionality.

For this assignment, you must submit one file named exactly Language.java containing the source code for your implementation of the Language class.

Submitted code must compile without error and exactly match the specified public API.

Submitted code is expected to be well-documented using Javadoc comments and tags. The class-level documentation must include @author and @version tags. The method-level documentation must use @param and @return tags as appropriate.

Assessment will consider correctness and readability.

You must also submit, via "Online text", a brief (~150 word) reflection addressing insights and learning associated with your experience working on this assignment.
